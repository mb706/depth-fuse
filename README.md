# Depth-Fuse

FUSE interface for Sony DPT-RP1 (and possibly other Sony DPT versions). Builds on [janten/dpt-rp1-py](https://github.com/janten/dpt-rp1-py) and was built before it had its own [implementation](https://github.com/janten/dpt-rp1-py/blob/master/bin/dptmount). This is my first Fuase FS and is probably more buggy than the one in janten/dpt-rp1-py but does caching and has the potential to be faster.
